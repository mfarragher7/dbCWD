# Top-down-vs.-bottom-up-control-of-DCMs
Code supplements for Lofton et al., Relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control of lake phytoplankton vertical distributions is mediated by functional traits.

Files:

Script_S1_DCM_curvefitting.R - guides the user through fitting a generalized normal distribution curve to a vertical profile of phytoplankton biomass; requires Example_fluorescence_profile_Script_S1.csv and Script_S2_GND_fit_functions.R as dependencies.

Example_fluorescence_profile_Script_S1.csv - example data for use in Script_S1

Script_S2_GND_fit_functions.R - dependent functions for Script_S1_DCM_curvefitting.R

Script_S3_SO_calculation.R - guides the user through calculating spatial overlap of multiple phytoplankton groups based on high-resolution vertical profiles of those groups; requires Example_fluorescence_profiles_Script_S3.csv as a dependency.

Example_fluorescence_profiles_Script_S3.csv - example data for use in Script_S3
